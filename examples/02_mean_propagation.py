"""Mean propagation estimator for ReLU MLPs — self-contained educational implementation.

For a ReLU unit  z = max(0, w^T x),  if the pre-activation is Gaussian:

    pre ~ N(mu_pre, sigma_pre^2)

then the exact first two moments of z are:

    E[z]   = mu_pre  * Phi(alpha) + sigma_pre * phi(alpha)
    E[z^2] = (mu_pre^2 + sigma_pre^2) * Phi(alpha) + mu_pre * sigma_pre * phi(alpha)
    Var[z] = E[z^2] - E[z]^2

where  alpha = mu_pre / sigma_pre,  phi is the standard normal PDF,
and Phi is the standard normal CDF.

This estimator propagates the mean and a *diagonal* variance (one scalar per
neuron, ignoring off-diagonal correlations) through every layer and returns the
post-ReLU mean for each layer stacked into a (depth, width) array.
