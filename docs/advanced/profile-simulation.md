# Profile Simulation Performance

> [← Documentation](../index.md)

## When to use this page

The starter kit uses flopscope as its single simulation backend — analytical FLOP counting replaces wall-clock timing across multiple backends. The `profile-simulation` command lets you verify FLOP accounting correctness and explore how FLOP costs scale with network size.

> This page covers the `whest profile-simulation` command for benchmarking the backend's correctness and FLOP scaling. For managing your estimator's FLOP budget during development, see [Manage Your FLOP Budget](../how-to/manage-flop-budget.md).

Use this page when you want to:

- **Verify flopscope is installed and correct** — the profiler runs a pre-flight correctness check before reporting FLOP data.
- **Understand FLOP scaling** — see how FLOP costs grow with width, depth, and budget so you can calibrate your estimator's budget usage.
- **Collect reproducible profiling data** — JSON output includes correctness results and FLOP accounting across network sizes.

## Do this now

### 1. Run a quick profile

```bash
whest profile-simulation --preset quick
```

This finishes in seconds and gives you a first look at FLOP accounting correctness and scaling.

### 2. Run the standard profile

```bash
whest profile-simulation
```

The default `standard` preset tests two widths (64, 256) and three depths (4, 32, 128). It gives a reliable picture of FLOP cost scaling across network sizes.

### 3. Save results for comparison

```bash
whest profile-simulation --output results.json
```

The JSON file contains correctness results and FLOP accounting data across all tested configurations.

## Choosing presets

| Preset | Widths | Depths | N_Samples | Typical time |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| `super-quick` | 256 | 4 | 10 000 | Sub-second |
| `quick` | 256 | 4, 128 | 10 000, 100 000 | Seconds |
| `standard` | 64, 256 | 4, 32, 128 | 10 000, 100 000 | Under a minute |
| `exhaustive` | 64, 256 | 4, 32, 128 | 10 000, 100 000, 1 000 000 | Minutes |

Use `quick` for a fast sanity check and `standard` for development decisions.

## Understanding the output

The terminal table shows:

- **Pre-flight Correctness Check** — PASS or FAIL for the flopscope backend. A FAIL indicates a version mismatch or installation problem.
- **FLOP Accounting Results** — one row per (width, depth) combination showing the total FLOPs reported by flopscope for a forward pass.

## Common workflows

### Debug a correctness failure

If the correctness check shows FAIL:

```bash
whest profile-simulation --preset quick --debug
```

The error message will indicate whether the issue is a numerical tolerance failure or a missing dependency.

### Export FLOP data for estimator calibration

```bash
whest profile-simulation --preset exhaustive --output flop_data.json
```

Use the FLOP counts in the JSON to understand how much budget your estimator consumes per layer, and tune your budget-allocation logic accordingly.

## Expected outcome

- The terminal displays a formatted table with correctness and FLOP accounting results.
- If `--output` is provided, a JSON file is written with full profiling data.
