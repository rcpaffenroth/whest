# Troubleshooting — When something breaks

> [← Documentation](../README.md)

If your run errored, your score regressed, or your local and remote scores disagree, start here.

| Doc | When to read |
|---|---|
| [common-participant-errors.md](common-participant-errors.md) | Symptom → cause → fix-now → verify, for the most common failures (wrong shape, NaN/Inf, exceeded budget, signature mismatches, import errors, numeric blow-up in deep networks). |
| [faq.md](faq.md) | Quick answers — can I use scipy? what is `untracked_time_limit`? why does my submission score worse than my local run? |

## ➡️ Where to look next

- Want the tiered procedure for "estimator runs but something feels wrong"? → [How-to: debugging checklist](../how-to/debugging-checklist.md).
- Suspect drift between machines? → [Reference: `whest doctor`](../reference/whest-doctor.md).
- Need to interpret `per_mlp[i].error`, `budget_exhausted`, `time_exhausted` fields? → [Reference: score report fields](../reference/score-report-fields.md).
