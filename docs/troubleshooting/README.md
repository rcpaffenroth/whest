# Troubleshooting — When something breaks

> [← Documentation](../README.md)

If your run errored, your score regressed, or your local and remote scores disagree, start here.

| Doc | When to read |
|---|---|
| [common-participant-errors.md](common-participant-errors.md) | Symptom → cause → fix-now → verify, for the most common failures (wrong shape, NaN/Inf, exceeded budget, signature mismatches, import errors, numeric blow-up in deep networks). |
| [faq.md](faq.md) | Quick answers — can I use scipy? what is `untracked_time_limit`? why does my submission score worse than my local run? |
