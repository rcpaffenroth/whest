# Manage Your FLOP Budget

## When to use this page

Use this page to understand how FLOP budgets work and how to optimize your estimator to stay within budget.

## Why FLOPs, not wall-clock time

This challenge scores estimators by **analytical FLOP count**, not execution time. Every mathematical operation your estimator performs is tracked by [flopscope](https://github.com/AIcrowd/flopscope) — a NumPy-compatible library that counts floating-point operations deterministically from tensor shapes.

This means your score is **hardware-independent**: the same estimator produces the same FLOP count on a laptop and a GPU cluster. You can focus on algorithmic efficiency rather than hardware tuning.

For the full flopscope API and cost model, see the [flopscope documentation](https://github.com/AIcrowd/flopscope).

## Which operations cost FLOPs

| Category | Examples | Cost |
|----------|----------|------|
| **Free (0 FLOPs)** | `fnp.array()`, `fnp.zeros()`, `fnp.ones()`, `fnp.reshape()`, `fnp.transpose()`, indexing, `fnp.concatenate()`, `fnp.stack()` | No budget impact |
| **Pointwise (1 FLOP/element)** | `fnp.add()`, `fnp.multiply()`, `fnp.exp()`, `fnp.sqrt()`, `fnp.maximum()` | Output element count |
| **Reductions** | `fnp.sum()`, `fnp.mean()`, `fnp.max()` | Input element count |
| **Matrix operations** | `fnp.matmul()`, `fnp.einsum()` | Depends on dimensions — typically dominates your budget |
| **Random generation** | `fnp.random.normal()`, `fnp.random.uniform()` | Output element count |

**Key insight:** `fnp.matmul` on `(n, n)` matrices costs `O(n^3)` FLOPs. For width-100 networks, a single matmul costs ~1M FLOPs. Most of your budget goes to matrix operations.

## Check your budget usage

Wrap your estimator logic in a `BudgetContext` to see how many FLOPs it consumes:

```python
import flopscope as flops

with flops.BudgetContext(flop_budget=100_000_000) as budget:
    result = estimator.predict(mlp, budget=100_000_000)

print(f"FLOPs used: {budget.flops_used:,}")
print(f"FLOPs remaining: {budget.flops_remaining:,}")
```

If you also want a wall-clock guardrail while debugging locally, set
`wall_time_limit_s` on the same `BudgetContext`:

```python
with flops.BudgetContext(
    flop_budget=100_000_000,
    wall_time_limit_s=2.0,
) as budget:
    result = estimator.predict(mlp, budget=100_000_000)
```

## Get a per-operation breakdown

Use `budget.summary()` for the current explicit context or
`flops.budget_summary()` for the session/global view to see which operations
consume the most FLOPs:

```python
import flopscope as flops

with flops.BudgetContext(flop_budget=100_000_000) as budget:
    result = estimator.predict(mlp, budget=100_000_000)
    print(budget.summary())

flops.budget_summary()
```

This prints a table showing each operation's name, call count, and cumulative FLOP cost — letting you identify the expensive operations to optimize.

The same summaries also show timing data:

- `wall_time_s`: total elapsed time for the context
- `tracked_time_s`: time spent inside counted flopscope calls
- `untracked_time_s`: time spent outside counted flopscope calls

In `whest run`, the CLI flags map to these concepts as follows:

- `--wall-time-limit`: forwards a wall-clock limit into the estimator's `BudgetContext`
- `--untracked-time-limit`: adds a WhestBench scoring check on the reported `untracked_time_s`

## Interpret `whest run` output

When you run your estimator with `whest run`, the per-MLP report includes:

- **`flops_used`**: total FLOPs your estimator consumed for that MLP.
- **`budget_exhausted`**: `true` if your estimator exceeded the FLOP budget — predictions were zeroed.
- **`final_mse`** / **`all_layer_mse`**: your prediction accuracy (lower is better).

If `budget_exhausted` is `true`, your predictions were discarded. You need to reduce FLOP usage.

## Worked walkthrough: mean propagation, line by line

The table below profiles [`examples/02_mean_propagation.py`](../../examples/02_mean_propagation.py) on the default Stage 1 MLP (`width=32, depth=6`). Numbers are aggregated across all 6 layers; per-layer cost is roughly the row total divided by 6. Reproduce with `flops.budget_summary()` after a single `predict()` call.

| Operation in `predict()` | Calls | FLOPs (total) | % of budget |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `mu_pre = w.T @ mu` and `var_pre = (w*w).T @ var` (`matmul`) | 12 | 393,216 | **96.2%** |
| `mu_pre * Phi_alpha + sigma_pre * phi_alpha` etc. (`multiply`) | 48 | 7,488 | 1.8% |
| `flops.stats.norm.pdf(alpha)` | 6 | 3,072 | 0.8% |
| `flops.stats.norm.cdf(alpha)` | 6 | 3,072 | 0.8% |
| `mu_pre * Phi_alpha + ...` etc. (`add`) | 18 | 576 | 0.1% |
| `fnp.maximum(var_pre, 1e-12)` (`maximum`) | 12 | 384 | 0.1% |
| `fnp.sqrt(var_pre)` | 6 | 192 | 0.0% |
| `mu_pre / sigma_pre` (`true_divide`) | 6 | 192 | 0.0% |
| `ez2 - mu*mu` (`subtract`) | 6 | 192 | 0.0% |
| `fnp.stack(rows, axis=0)` | 1 | 192 | 0.0% |
| **Total per `predict()`** | — | **408,576** | — |

Two takeaways:

- **`matmul` dwarfs everything else.** 96% of the budget is two matmuls per layer. Halving the matmul count (e.g., switching to a diagonal-only formulation) buys you ~50% of the budget back.
- **Reductions, sqrt, and divides are free in practice.** Don't twist your code to avoid them; the cost is in the tens of FLOPs per layer.

The same pattern holds at production widths — only the absolute numbers change. Re-run the profile on `examples/03_*.py` to see the `O(width³)` matmul cost dominate even harder.

## Optimization tips

1. **Matmul dominates.** Each `fnp.matmul(W.T, mu)` on a `(width, width)` matrix costs `O(width^2)` FLOPs per layer. Reducing the number of matmuls (or their dimensions) has the biggest impact.

2. **Diagonal approximations save FLOPs.** Mean propagation uses diagonal variance (`O(width^2)` per layer) instead of full covariance propagation (`O(width^3)` per layer). Choose the right level of approximation for your budget.

3. **Array creation is free.** `fnp.array()`, `fnp.zeros()`, `fnp.ones()`, `fnp.eye()` cost 0 FLOPs. Precompute and store intermediate values freely.

4. **Use the combined estimator pattern.** Route between cheap (mean propagation) and expensive (covariance propagation) algorithms based on the available FLOP budget. See [`examples/04_combined.py`](../../examples/04_combined.py).
