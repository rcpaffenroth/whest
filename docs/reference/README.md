Lookup material. No tutorials here — go to [How-to](../how-to/) for guidance, [Concepts](../concepts/) for the why, [Tutorial](../getting-started/) for the climbing trail.

## Estimator API

| Doc | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [estimator-contract.md](estimator-contract.md) | Required `predict(mlp, budget)` signature, optional `setup`/`teardown` lifecycle, `SetupContext` field reference, output requirements, and a failure-semantics table mapping every failure mode to the report field that surfaces it. |
| [code-patterns.md](code-patterns.md) | `flopscope` patterns: what's free, what costs, the rectified-Gaussian first-moment derivation, and the regimes where the Gaussian assumption breaks. |
| [local-engine-api.md](local-engine-api.md) | The `local_engine.py` factory and Monte-Carlo helpers used in Stage 1. |

## FLOP and scoring details

| Doc | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [flopscope-primer.md](flopscope-primer.md) | `BudgetContext` ownership across stages, complete public-attribute reference (`flops_used`, `flops_remaining`, `wall_time_s`, …), and the op cost table. |
| [score-report-fields.md](score-report-fields.md) | Every field you'll see in `whest run` output, with interpretation guidance. |

## CLI

| Doc | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [cli-reference.md](cli-reference.md) | Pointer at the upstream `whest` CLI documentation. |
| [whest-doctor.md](whest-doctor.md) | Each `whest doctor` health check, what it verifies, and how to fix a `WARN` or `FAIL` row. |
