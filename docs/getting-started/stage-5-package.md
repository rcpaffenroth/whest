You've climbed the ladder. Now ship it.

## 🚀 Run it

```bash
uv run whest package --estimator estimator.py --output submission.tar.gz
```

This bundles **your estimator's entire folder** (minus `.whestignore` entries and built-in ignores) into `submission.tar.gz`. Before writing the archive, `whest package` shows a file/size preview and asks for confirmation; pass `--yes` / `-y` to skip the prompt in CI. The submission must stay within **50 MiB** and **50 files** — use `.whestignore` to exclude scratch files, caches, or large artefacts you don't need on the grader.

Helper modules and data files (e.g. `weights.npz`) kept next to `estimator.py` ship automatically — no extra flags needed. See [Ship Weights and Multi-File Submissions](../how-to/ship-weights.md) for the full walkthrough.

## 📤 Submit to AIcrowd

Ship it straight from the CLI — no manual portal upload needed.

First, log in once with your AIcrowd API key (grab it from your
[AIcrowd profile](https://www.aicrowd.com/participants/me/customize)):

```bash
uv run whest login
```

Then submit. `whest submit` packages your estimator's folder and uploads it to
the challenge in one step (you can also submit a prebuilt tarball):

```bash
# package + submit in one go
uv run whest submit --estimator estimator.py

# or submit a tarball you already built
uv run whest submit submission.tar.gz
```

Add `--watch` to follow the submission until it's graded:

```bash
uv run whest submit --estimator estimator.py --watch
```

Prefer the browser? The packaged `submission.tar.gz` still uploads fine on
the AIcrowd challenge submission page.

## What's in the artifact

- Every non-ignored file in your estimator's folder (helper modules, `weights.npz`, and any other data files you keep next to `estimator.py`) — collected automatically; no extra flags needed
- `manifest.json` — entrypoint, whestbench/flopscope/numpy versions, Python version, per-file SHA-256, and package timestamp
- `requirements.txt` — only when your estimator pulls in extra packages (frozen from your `uv.lock`)

## After submission

What happens once `whest submit` (or a portal upload) accepts your
`submission.tar.gz`:

1. **AIcrowd unpacks the artifact** into a clean grader container that
   pre-installs the runner’s `whestbench` release plus the contents of
   your `requirements.txt`.
2. **The grader runs your estimator** against a held-out
   MLP suite (same `width`, `depth`, `flop_budget` as the public
   defaults; same `n_mlps` order of magnitude), in an isolated
   subprocess inside a sandboxed container. No network, no GPU,
   no access to the local filesystem outside `SetupContext.submission_dir` (your shipped files) and `SetupContext.scratch_dir`.
3. **Your `setup()` runs once.** If it raises, the run is recorded as a
   failed submission with the traceback surfaced in the AIcrowd UI.
4. **`predict()` is called per MLP.** Errors per call are captured but
   don't kill the run — predictions for that MLP are scored against
   zeros. Repeated failures will tank `adjusted_final_layer_score`.
5. **The leaderboard updates** with `adjusted_final_layer_score` once the run
   finishes.

If the leaderboard score disagrees with your Stage 4 score by more than
a percent or two, the suspects are listed in the
[FAQ](../troubleshooting/faq.md#my-local-score-is-great-but-my-submission-scores-10x-worse--why).

If you suspect a grader-side issue (your submission errors out without
your local Stage 4 doing so), open a thread on the
[challenge discussion forum](https://www.aicrowd.com/) with the
submission ID — that's the quickest path to a human.

## ✅ Expected outcome

| Stage | What you should see | Action if not |
|---|---|---|
| Local Stage 4 score | ≈ leaderboard score within ~1–2% | Check Stage 4 vs Stage 3 first — drift between them surfaces the same bugs that the grader will hit |
| `submission.tar.gz` size | Typically 2–10 KB for a pure-Python estimator; tens of MB if you ship weight files (50 MiB cap enforced by `whest package`) | If unexpectedly large, check for scratch files and use `.whestignore` to exclude them |
| Grader runtime | A few minutes for the default suite | Slower than that suggests `residual_wall_time_s` issues — see [score-report-fields.md](../reference/score-report-fields.md) |
