"*Just `flopscope`*" means: **no `whest` CLI required**. You run `python estimator.py` and the bundled [`local_engine.py`](../../local_engine.py) constructs an MLP, calls your `predict()` inside a `flopscope.BudgetContext`, and sweeps Monte-Carlo sample counts to print a FLOPs-vs-MSE table. The `whestbench.BaseEstimator` and `whestbench.MLP` types you'll see imported are just the shared dataclasses — they don't pull in the harness.

Iterate here until `predict()` converges, then climb to Stage 2 to confirm the contract.

## 🚀 Run it

```bash
uv run python estimator.py
```

You should see a table like:

```
--- Your estimator ---
MLP: width=256 depth=8 seed=0

 n_samples | sampling_flops | estimator_flops |        MSE
----------------------------------------------------------
        10 |     10,551,808 |               0 |   0.706450
       100 |    105,499,648 |               0 |   0.718928
     1,000 |  1,054,978,048 |               0 |   0.739125
    10,000 | 10,549,762,048 |               0 |   0.735092
   100,000 | 105,497,602,048 |               0 |   0.737172
```

The stub `predict()` returns all zeros, so `estimator_flops` is `0` and the MSE
plateaus at the variance of the true outputs — once you put real math in
`predict()`, both columns come alive and the MSE should shrink roughly as
`1/sqrt(n_samples)` (Monte Carlo converging to your estimator's answer).

## Edit `predict()`

Open [estimator.py](../../estimator.py). The body of `predict()` returns all zeros — replace it with your idea. The template already imports `flopscope as flops` and `flopscope.numpy as fnp`, so any array op you write through `fnp` (or via Python operators on `fnp` arrays) is FLOP-counted automatically. Re-run; the MSE column tells you how close you are, and `estimator_flops` shows what your math cost.

## Compare against a baseline

```bash
uv run python estimator.py --baseline mean_propagation
```

This loads `examples/02_mean_propagation.py` and runs both estimators on the same MLP.

## ✅ Expected outcome

| Estimator | MSE on the default MLP | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Zeros template (default) | ~0.74 | floor — natural variance of the activations |
| `--baseline mean_propagation` | ~0.0005 | ~1400x better; first-order analytical |
| `--baseline covariance_propagation` | ~0.00002 | ~20x better than mean; tracks neuron correlations |

You're ready for Stage 2 once your estimator's MSE is comfortably below
the zeros floor and `estimator_flops` stays under whatever budget you'd
target downstream (Stage 3's grader default is `6.8e10`).

## ✅ When you're ready

Move on to [Stage 2: validate the contract](stage-2-validate.md).
